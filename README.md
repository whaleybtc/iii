# build-account.pipeline.side8

This Cloudformation enables pipeline.side8 Build Account functionality on an AWS account.

After an initial bootstrap it can itself be managed by pipeline.side8 by configuring `.s8/pipeline.yml`, altho care should be taken when naming Build Account stacks in multi-Build Account setups.
